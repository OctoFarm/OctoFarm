    OctoFarm is an easy to setup and install web server and client for unifying multiple instances of Octoprint. <br/>You can manage and monitor as many instances as you want from a single interface giving you full control over your 3D printer farm.

## About The Project
OctoFarm was built to fill a need that anyone with multiple 3D printers with Octoprint will have run into. How do I
manage multiple printers from one place? That's where OctoFarm steps in, add your OctoPrint instances to the system and
it will scan and keep you up to date on the status of your printers.

## Prerequisites

In order to have OctoFarm running using a local installation of NodeJS and MongoDB as database, please be aware of the following minimum version requirements:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - v3.6+
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) - v14.0.0 (Latest tested: v14.16.1)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - v6.10.0+ (Latest tested: v7.17.0)
- [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org) - v1.3.9+

### OS / Platform for OctoFarm
Confirmed working on:
- Windows 10/11 (direct or with chocolatey)
> Find the chocolatey package here: https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/octofarm 
> This will install all dependencies NodeJS, MongoDB and OctoFarm with pm2  
- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian)
- FarmPi (Raspberry Pi 3A+ or newer)
> Find the FarmPi image for Raspberry Pi 3A+ or newer here: https://github.com/mkevenaar/FarmPi
> Please make sure to NOT install OctoPrint(s) on the same system and limit yourself to amount of printers in the table https://github.com/mkevenaar/FarmPi#supported-printers 

Should also work on but not tested:
- MacOS
- _Anything else NodeJS 14+ will run on._

Avoid the following, known to be tough to get working: 
- Raspberry Pi OS - go for the **FarmPi Ubuntu** image instead (https://github.com/mkevenaar/FarmPi/releases/latest)!

_Note_: Raspberry Pi's OS is 32 bits, although 64 bits is available but harder to find. Both the docker containers as well as direct install is hard to get working. The docker containers seem to fail on wrong architecture and direct install fails on a 64 bits MongoDB requirement. 

### Important note OctoPrint 1.4.1+

<span style="color:red">Avoid using a **Global API Key!**</span><br/>
<span style="color:lime">Generate an **Application** or **User API Key!**</span><br/>

OctoPrint WebSocket connection **will fail** when providing the **Global API** Key and **OctoFarm will therefore not accept this type of OctoPrint key**. You must generate an **Application Key** or **User API key** from your OctoPrint account. Your logged in user requires the groups **Admin** and **Operator** (or simply all permissions), or we cannot guarantee a 100% succesful OctoFarm experience.

### Preparing OctoPrint User API Key / Application Key

Follow all these steps **on the specific OctoPrint website**:
- User Name -> User Settings
- Copy the **User API Key** (or alternatively **Application Key** in System Settings, **but never the Global API Key!**)
- Enable the Allow Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) setting
- Restart OctoPrint
- Repeat for all OctoPrints that will be added to the Farm

## Getting Started
Please choose the direct NodeJS installation or the Docker image.
1) Installing OctoFarm - read the following: [OctoFarm.net installation instructions](https://octofarm.net/installation) 
2) Docker image(s) [docker or docker-compose usage instructions](./docs/USING_DOCKER.md)
3) Installation for Development (Node 14+, Nodemon)

### Installation - for Development only!
_This is for devs or testers only! It is not practical to use `nodemon` for normal usage as `nodemon` does not add a service like `pm2` (option 1) or `docker` (option 1 and 2). Please, if you are a normal user, check out [OctoFarm.net installation instructions](https://octofarm.net/installation) instead!_

So nice that you want to test or develop OctoFarm!

1. Clone the OctoFarm

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NotExpectedYet/OctoFarm.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Create an .env file with the MONGO variable:

```
MONGO=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/octofarm
```

3a. Custom MongoDB parameters, like from a `docker-compose.yml` file. In that case, see [docker or docker-compose usage instructions](./docs/USING_DOCKER.md) but we do expect you to be able to adapt what is needed.

```
# Docker alternative
MONGO=mongodb://mongo_compose_service_name_here:compose_exposed_port_here/octofarm
```

3b. OR **if you have a password or other different parameters** (credentials, host, port or authSource):

```
MONGO=mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/octofarm?authSource=admin
```

4. Install nodemon

```sh
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

5. Start the system

```sh
npm run dev
```
- The developer version uses nodemon for live server reloading on changes. It will output all the logs to the console.
- The developer version will skip some basic sanity checks, if your pages don't load right after server boot then it's
  because those sanity checks haven't finished.

## Contributing
The awesome project OctoFarm needs extra contributors to move even faster! If you feel like you have what it takes, and want to join the fun please head over to discord with
the following link: [Discord](https://discord.gg/vjabMUn) and speak to us in Developer Discussions. Thanks!

### Work on version 1.2.x-rc2
Version 1.2.x-rc2 is our current OctoFarm release on the `development` branch. This has the following specs:
- NodeJS 14+ (version 12 was dropped to support better syntax like the optional chaining operator `?`)
- ExpressJS with `ejs` and `ejs-express-layouts`
- Mongoose and MongoDB

We are working hard to prepare version 1.2.x for the upgrade to a newer Typescripty OctoFarm in version 2.0! Continue reading for that version below.

### Work on version 2.0
Version 2.0 is underway on the `alpha-2x` branch. This will have the following specs:
- Node 14+ support
- NestJS backend with Typescript
- TypeORM database Object-Relational Mapper with Typescript
- SQLite (instead of MongoDB)
- (Optional) VueJS client is introduced
