# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible
receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| CVSS v3.0 | Supported Versions                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1.2.x  | Most recent releases |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to
**[online@notexpectedyet.com](mailto:online@notexpectedyet.com)**. You will receive a response from
us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity but historically as soon as possible.
