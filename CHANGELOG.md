## [v1.1.5.7]

### Added
    - Formalised the data json layout for Environmental Data collection same POST endpoint as before. Must send null values for anything not used: 
            {
                temperature: value (°C),
                humidity: value (%),
                iaq: value (KOhms),
                pressure: value (Pa)
                date: value
            }.
    - Configurable dashboard. Allows the elements to be hidden/removed in System -> Client Settings -> Dashboard. You can also re-arrange your elements as well as re-size them to suit your needs.
    - Initial very basic support for Klipper Plugin, OctoFarm will now grab Klippers version information and display it under OctoPrints on the printer management.
    - Added server side check for CORS activation. UI on printer manager will react...
    - New Dashboard settings in System -> Client. Shows saved grid, and allows for adding/removing elements and clearing positions/sizes.
    - Added new printer manager section called "Connection Log". Just a ticker with recent API calls for now, errors will show up here and you can investigate in the printer settings.
    - New file manager sorting library. All previous defaults will no longer work, defaults to lastest files first. 
    - If available last Indoor Air Quality value will be displayed. 
    - Indoor Air Quality value updated to follow bosch range. 0 - 500 from Excellent air quality to Extremely Polluted.
    - Ability to upload a file to replace the background. System -> Client.
    - Remember me select box on login page, currently will remember your session for 30 days. Does not persist an OctoFarm reboot. More configuration options to be added.
    - Updated custom NPM commands for OctoFarm: 
        - "npm start" - Runs OctoFarm service, will now automatically run npm install so this step is no longer required.
        - "npm stop" - Stops OctoFarm service.
        - "npm startup" - Generates system startup script so OctoFarm is persistent. You will need to copy and paste the output command into your terminal to activate this. Then use the below script to save the configuration. Same as "pm2 startup"
        - "npm saveStartup" - Saves the current configuration generated from "npm startup". Same as "pm2 save" 
    - New section in "System Settings" called "Database". Currently displays the db URL and also allows some basic deleting (tactical nuke) of a database.
    - New Printer selection modal, this is currently for Multi-Upload in files manager but will eventually be used in the rest of the UI.
   
### Changed
    - OctoFarm now reacts to the enabled camera setting on OctoPrint. If you don't use camera's it is best to disable them here. 
    - OctoFarm will now only respond to a max screen size of 2000px. Anything above this will be limited from stretching to the full horizontal width.
    - Fixed issue #102 - UI Redraw causing missed clicks. 
    - Moved Logs above About on System Side bar. 
    - Files no longer "a" element, can't be clicked anymore. Was confusing, suggested an action.
    - Implemented new file sorting function. Settings default to name, and will save per client in local storage.
    - File path now shows on hover if available in History table.
    - Tweaks to SSE browser cache, should force re-update of data rather than blasting the client with a lot of data as it caught up... (Testing and feedback would be awesome)
    - Client side images/javascript/css is now minified and generates a source map properly for all dependancies. This should improve load times, and increase browser support going forward. These are pre-built for the client, so no action required on a users part. 

### Fixed
    - Fixed file path showing on file selection instead of file name
    - Fixed Paused print not allowing cancel on Panel view.
    - Issue with session not been read when accessing site. Should save uneccassary logins. NOTE: These do not persist a OctoFarm restart.

    - Fixed issue with file name filter not working with special characters on history
    - Fixed issue with file manager sorting not allowing update within folders.
    - Fixed issue with new files not showing above folder. Sorting/re-loading page will re-organise. 
    - Fixed issue with filament manager failing system file import on server start
    - Fixed issue # 108 reliance on storage key was causing UI to lock up, and system wasn't re-scanning if didn't exist.
    - Fixed issue with file manager not removing file.
    
## Removed
    - Client side sorting library for printers - Not added back yet due to been a little more complex than first anticipated.

## [v1.1.5.6]

### Added
    - File Manager now displays the success/failure/last stats from OctoPrint
    - New API Endpoint for collecting enviromental data. Expected the following JSON format: {temperature: value (°C), humidity:value (%), gas_resistance: value (KOhms), date: value}. Null values are required when no data present. (MongoDB is NOT a time series database, this is capped at 90000 records... )
    - Dashboard will now show envriomental history... currently shows hard coded last 4000 records. From your data you will get a Temperature and Humidity Graph and also an IAQ Score (if you supply gas_resistance, not all sensors read this data.). If you use the BME680 find out more here: https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BME680-DS001.pdf 


### Changed

    - Added a true server alive check. Client now polls this whilst active and throws a modal up when connection lost. Will reload the page automatically (manual also) when connection restored. 
  
### Changed
    - Make a note of the plugin/settings hash
    - Adding a printer will now show Printer State as "Awaiting WebSocket" until the websocket updates the printers status.
    - File list is now stored in database to save re-scanning on server load.
    - Added timeout to file scanning, will only try to update 4 times then await users resync for information.
    - Thumbnails are now stored with history in /images/historyCollection/thumbs. The /images folder will need mounting to docker to make this persistent if you want to use this feature. 

### Fixed
    - Fixed Add Printer table not clearing correctly.
    - Fixed connection to OctoPrint for release of 1.4.1. Caveat, can no longer use global API key. Fixed #85 & #89

### Changed
    - Moved the file manager management buttons outside of the Printers and Files list. This keeps them at the top whilst scrolling inside your files.

    - Panel view now shows file thumbnail if available and no camera is set.
    - Printer Control window now shows file thumbnail if available on selected job.
    - State runner now updates octoprint job information with the selected thumbnail and filament length so this information can be used on the client.
    - Started counting individual printer error/cancelled/success ratio
    - Re-configured the printer control view:
        - Moved all the elements into new positions. Hopefully this brings more focus on what's used all the time, and it also allows for upcoming modifications to see extra tools/chamber temperatures. 
        - Converted Terminal input to multi-line input
    - File List now shows actions buttons as bar across bottom of file.
    - database configuration now defaults to localhost address for db uri.
    - The File list now shows Filament Cost and Printer Cost seperate. 
        - Filament Cost requires a filament to be selected to generate. Re-Sync to update.  
        - Printer Cost requires your printer costs been filled in in Printer Settings and also requires an expected time to be generated. 
    - Client now uses service workers for information retrieval. 
    - History information now generated on server side then sent to the client, should improve loading times. 
    - Filament information now generated on server side then sent to the client, should improve loading times. 
    - Printer Control improvements, now shows loading spinner when loading/switching to a different print. Speeds should be slightly improved``
        - Printer Control now live reloads filament/file changes. Shouldn't need to re-sync nearly as much manually. 
        - First re-sync will happen after 1000ms, trigger by file upload/filament change. Second re-sync on file upload first after 10000ms, this isn't always enough for OctoPrint to generate file meta so manual re-sync maybe required after this.
    - Printer Management buttons have been moved to a card body. 
    - Docker no longer installs & updates node_modules on start if the folder exists.
    - Camera's on OctoFarm now respect the camera enabled setting within OctoPrint. If disabled it will attempt to display the currently selected files thumbnail, failing both the cameraurl and thumbnail url will not load the camera block.
    - Filament selection has been combined into the Tools header for list view. 
    
### Fixed
    - Fix file manager bug with default date sorting.
    - Fixed styling issue with the filters and sorting dropdowns on views making the bar bigger.

    - Server reboot has a notification and no longer needs page to re-load. Live updating. 
    - Improved loading times on history with pre-calculating the list values server side. 
    - Filament manager failed on re-syncing due to changes when adding spools/profiles. 
    - Speed improvements with new backend pre-calculation. All information should be prepared ready for client access before access. 
    - Fixed #77 - Farm Utilisation not calculated correctly.
    - Filament Manager plugin tweaks: Fixed #73 and #74
        - Filament Manager now keeps up to date when filament is down dated. It will re-sync your filament library after a print.
        - Improved log output and it's own file. 
        - Server start fires a re-sync to make sure no changes are missed.
        - Caveat: OctoFarm doesn't know when you change a filament on OctoPrint, any changes you make there for filament, you will need to tell OctoFarm with a Re-Sync/Spool selection.
    - Fixed #79 - Duplicate historical entries due to multiple listeners getting assigned on printer edit/delete.
    - Fixed some dependancy security issues and updated node modules. Please make sure to run npm install / npm update if you've already installed node_modules. 
    
### Removed
    - History may not now show your selected spool for old records with no job information caught. This is mainly going to be cancelled/failed prints as there is no information caught or prints that start and finish before OctoPrint can generate the job information. OctoFarm now relies on the tool# information provided in this for captured histories to render spool information correctly.

                - pm2 stop OctoFarm: Stops the running OctoFarm service. 
                - pm2 restart OctoFarm: Restarts the running OctoFarm service. 
        - exec: Used for executing the pm2 scripts for restarting OctoFarm server. 
    - Much improved logging for all areas. Now creates new log files as follows:

### Changed
    - Dashboard has had a re-vamp.
        - Printers are now added inline. Clicking "+ Add Printer" will pop up a box to the top of your printer list. Deleting it can be removed, and saving the printer it will be added to a new row on the list and start off a scan. A notification will be generated after a connection attempt. 
    - Closed is now renamed to Disconnected. This is when your USB port is not connected to OctoPrint. 
    - Server Settings only accessible by Administrator.
    - Filament moved from System Menu to the navigation bar. 
    - Switched over to new platform for feature requests: https://features.octofarm.net
    - Split the Printer states for the dashboard to make it clearer. There is now the following: 
        - WebSocket: 
            - Green: connected.
            - Yellow: Live but not receiving data. This is usually due to your printer been disconnected from OctoPrint when added as no data is transmitted from OctoPrint. 
            - Red: not connected.
        - Host State:
            - Online: Host connection active
            - Shutdown: Cannot connect to host
        - Printer State: 
            - Disconnected: Printer not connected to OctoPrint.
            - No-API: Failed to grab API status, usually due to CORS if Host State = Online.
            - The usual OctoPrint states: Idle, Printing, Cancelling, Error, Paused, Pausing
    - Full file manager added to Printer Control pop-up.
    - Printer Manager now split (Old Setting Cog):

            - File selection here now has the majority of the File Manager functionality for a single printer. 
        - Printer Settings (Cog Icon): Anything that's a 1 time settings, so Settings, Alerts, Power and Gcode Scripts
        - Printer Power (Power Icon): Will open the power menu for shutdown, restart, reboot and custom buttons setup in the Printer Settings Modal.
    - Split the information generation for Server -> Client comminication, will save some CPU on serverside and client side... 
    - If printer name not available will default to IP. 
    - Converted to using a full URL string for printer connection... 
        - If you already have port:ip set in the database this will be automagically converted for you. It will default to http:// when creating the new field. 
        - Anyone adding and setting up new printers will have to use the full URL string now. If you leave http:// out it will automatically add that in as default. 
    - Camera URL is similar to above, it will automagically add in the http:// for you if you have previous items in the database, you may also specify your own connection string with https://.
    - Temperature values no longer use the external buttons on the input. This is now a number field and uses the original HTML up and down arrows that appear on focus.
    - Export printers now exports with the following tags: Printer Name, Printer Group, Printer URL, Camera URL and API Key
    - Import printers no longer deletes all old printers to import new ones. The new printers are added to your existing list. 
    - Completed Prints are now triggered by percent complete rather than Print time left as it seems prints can get left with time left when actually completed.
    - Moved all detailed instructions to the WIKI page, and removed from README.md.
    - Views progress bars now display colours to corrospond with state. Yellow = Currently printing, Green = Complete. 
    - Camera View now displays text on the print and cancel buttons.

## [v1.1.4-6-bugfix]

### Added 

 - Added back in the re-sync all button. This will fire off the same re-sync command as the printer one but for all printers. 
 - Websockets connections are now indicated separately to Printer Status. The Printer Icon on the dashboard will show this status. 
    - Green = Currently connected
    - Yellow = Attempting a connection
    - Red = Disconnected.  
 - State now grabs an Error and displays on the printer status label if one occurs until rectified. 
 - Show printer index on printer with no name
 - Current Operations Card on view's now displays the predicted end date and time, calculated from the current date + print time remaining.
 - More Checks into the API/Websocket connection... if it fails to grab your API Key it will now warn you. You will see "No-API" in the state. Pressing the refresh button for your printer on dashboard will attempt a reconnect. 
 - Current Operations allows you to now de-select a file and remove it from the view. When a print is complete, you will see a "Harvest Your Print!" button, click it to remove the printer from that View.
 - Added configuration options to /serverConfig/timeout.js - This is for any printer that doesn't respond quick enough i.e the Prusa instances have shown to have this issue. Issue #26.

### Changed
 - Dashboard layout has been updated with a fixed sidebar. Medium sized screens and above will display this. 
 - Refactored mobile views for dashboard - See Deprecated.
 - Current Operations now viewable on mobile.
 - async information reception from server -> client. 
 - State should now show if Serial Error occurs on OctoPrint.
 - Shutdown printers, that have been scanned by the farm will now wait 15-seconds before trying to grab an API connection. This should help those with websockets not connecting initially.
 - History now captures and displays selected rolls of filament. No usage available from OctoPrint currently.
 - An initial API connection timeout now increases until it hit's an upper limit. So all API connections will attempt at the default of 1000ms, this will then increase to 10000ms after the first attempt hitting the upper limit and hard fail afterwards. These are configurable in serverConfig/server.js.
 
### Deprecated

 - Mobile view printer list no longer available due to dashboard changes. Will be returning in later release. 

### Fixed
 - Issue #21 - Camera View and Panel view don't respect Offline/Shutdown printer hiding.
 - Sometimes when removing printers would incorrectly try to update the state still.
 - Some offline/shutdown Printers would try ask to Re-Sync when not required due to still been offline/shutdown.
 - My git account... pushes as myself now. Hopefully...
 - Camera View Current Operations now updates with printers.
 - Fixed issue with Current Operations not clearing final finished or ended print card. 
 - Issue #22 - File Manager crashes when using Canvas Hub.
 - Docker should now correctly put logs into log folder.
 - Freshly created filament is now found and saved in the history logs. 
 - Issue #26 - File timeout issues. 
    - This issue is down to a ludicrously large amount of gcode files stored on a persons OctoPrint system. If your a gcode hoarder and having issues with your files scanning into OctoFarm you will need to play with the API connections, or do some house keeping. Anyone else you won't know any different.
    - Some numbers reported back from a user:
        - sub 200 files, was completely fine. 
        - 380 + files will nearly hit the full second api timeout which is 10 seconds...
        - 670 + files you will need to play with the system timeout I've created to get those to scan. 
    - I will be working to make improvements to this in the future where possible but for now the timeout changes will succeed and I believe it's only an edge set of users that get this effect going by reports I've had. If you do not, do not worry. 

## [v1.1.4-2-bugfix]

### Added
 - New states to OctoPrint detection... Now includes and reacts to "Searching..." + "Shutdown".
    - Searching... will be shown when OctoFarm is trying to make a connection to to OctoPrint... 
    - If the OctoPrint host is unreachable it will enter an Shutdown state... NOTE: If OctoPrint instance is added in a shutdown state, it currently get's stuck in Searching... a Re-Sync will refresh this.
    
### Changed 
 - All screens updated to respond to the changes.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with passworded/non-passworded OctoPrint instances running on 1.4.0 not re-establishing web sockets. 
- Fixed issue with adding printers offline, not correctly re-establishing websocket connection.
- Fixed issue with Shutdown Instances, ie. the OctoPrint host been turned off, causing server crash.
- Current Operations correctly loads if all printers are added offline, no display error requiring refresh.


## [Released]

## [v1.1.4-bugfix]

### Added

- Added windows specific docker-compose example to README

### Changed

- Offline Polling is now back. System -> Server Settings to change and click save to update.
- Updated the note on the settings screen to better reflect this and it's affect. Yes I like potato's.
- Changed the whole websocket implementation to help with issue #15. NOTE: If you add your printer to the farm offline, you may still need to re-sync (dashboard re-sync button) it to get it detected by the farm. I'm working on why this is happening still. Printers added Online then going Offline do not encounter this. This is also the case for restarting the server with offline printers. 

### Removed

### Deprecated

### Fixed

- Fixed the errant " displayed on all views
- Fixed the errant . when loading offline printers.
